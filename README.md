# soundcloud-optimize
make soundlcoud not suck

Deletes previous songs on the Soundcloud stream to speed it up when a large amount of songs are loaded.

Soundcloud gets pretty slow on the stream as you scroll. This extension deletes songs before the current playing track to 
help reduce the load of the page while listening. You can adjust the rate at which the extension removes the songs, the 
default is 10 minutes.
